<h1> Introduction</h1>

I am not a big fan of a gymnasium. I have tried the usual routine stuff at the gym but always find it repetetive and boring because when it comes to recreational  stuff, I love being in the outdoors. As a kid, I used to love riding bicycles.I left riding  in my mid-teenage because I felt like  big boys ride motorcycles not bicyles.Haha,I was just a kid...
About 6 months ago, I decided to ride again. Because I live in Los Angeles and the roads are not bicycle friendly, I decided to get myself an entry level mountain bike from amazon as we have few trails around here.
My sole purpose of building this app is to review mountain bike trails. User can upload a picture from their phone or computer of the trail they love or hate and leave a review and rating.
